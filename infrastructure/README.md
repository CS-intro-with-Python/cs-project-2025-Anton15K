# Infrastructure Notes

This directory collects deployment and operations resources. Planned assets include:

- `docker-compose` overrides for development, testing, and production
- Infrastructure-as-code templates for Railway.app or alternative platforms
- CI/CD pipeline definitions and environment configuration snippets

As the project evolves, add artifacts here to keep operational knowledge centralized.
